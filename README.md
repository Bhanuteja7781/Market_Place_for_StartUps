🚀 Venture Hub – A Unified Startup Marketplace for Founders & Investors

Venture Hub is a full-stack startup marketplace designed to bring founders and investors onto a single unified platform. Unlike traditional platforms where users must choose a single role, Venture Hub allows any user to list their own startup while also investing in others, creating a collaborative and dynamic ecosystem.

The core idea behind Venture Hub is simplicity and inclusiveness. Founders can showcase their startups with complete details, while investors can easily explore opportunities, connect directly with founders, and track projects they are interested in — all within one application.

📚 Learning & Experience

Building Venture Hub was a valuable hands-on experience in designing scalable full-stack architecture, implementing secure authentication flows, managing media uploads, syncing services using event-driven workflows, and building admin-level controls for real-world use cases.

This project reflects continuous learning and experimentation with modern web technologies. Venture Hub is still evolving, and feedback is always welcome.

🚀 Still learning. Still building. Open to feedback, discussions, and collaborations.
